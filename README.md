### Short introduction

#### OSF

> The OSF is a free web app that supports project management and collaboration,
> connects services across the research lifecycle, and archives data, materials,
> and other research objects for private use or public sharing. The Center for
> Open Science launched new features for the OSF to provide a more efficient user
> experience within the institutional environment. Through collaboration with
> institutions, COS is offering a branded, dedicated landing page to display all
> projects and users affiliated with your institution. 

#### protocols

> The protocols are dynamic and interactive on the platform. They are not just
> static PDFs but are “runnable” on the web and mobile (both iOS and Android),
> with the ability to follow a method step-by-step during an experiment, helping
> to perform the technique and to easily record all changes in the process. Even
> more importantly, all these methods can be discussed and improved on
> protocols.io, long after publication.
